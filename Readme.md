## ML Portfolio

##### These are my final projects (Jupyter notebooks + reports) for the courses which are part of the IBM ML Professional Certificate on Coursera. 

##### Each notebook comes with an index, clearly defined sections, step by step explanations, comments on the results and several plots. Also, the notebooks reference, when applicable, the IBM laboratories of the respective course whenever the code in the notebook has used code lines from the labs. Useful links with respect to the topic are also included for more learning. 

##### If you'd like to use similar ideas to develop your project for the certificate, please message me first :) I hope my own ideas can give you some good ones or insight into the types of problems to solve for the certificate. Also, if you have any comments on the projects, advice, tips for improvement, let me know! :D
